# Stock-Performance-GUI
In this project, I created an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to show the SP500 companies' performances over time. The first page shows all stocks that have low or high returns and volatility, plotting 5 stocks' closing prices and returns for a user's preferred return period, which is between 1-15 months. The simulation data consists of stock data from August 2015, providing robust information for return periods of every stock. 
The second page provides users a chance to learn more about individual stocks and companies with the same return and simulation range as the first page. 


**Note: This is not stock trading advice. This dashboard is only meant for users to understand how certain companies are performing**
